# character-table-of-Sn
Small python program to calculate the character table of the permutation group Sn.

I suggest to run the jupyter notebook because it makes it easier to inspect interim results. I also added a small LaTeX section to explain how to calculate 
the ```K``` matrix that contains the Kostka numbers. 
The script contains the same code.

You can specify the number of symbols that are permuted by setting the global variable ```N```.

I tested the code for up to ```N = 10``` and it seemed to work.
